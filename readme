# Fellow Frontend Interview Challenge
## Overview
For this interview you will be building the "Shop" page, which is a catalogue (of sorts)
of all our products. Your design should visually match the mocks given, the buttons should
update the app's state when clicked, and your implementation should be able to handle an
arbitrary number of products (do not assume there will always be 3 shown).
**You can google React documentation and any other documentation as needed.**
The challenge will proceed like this:
- `.first()` There is a bug üêõ in the app! The first stage of the interview is a debugging challenge.

- `.then()` After you fix the bug, you will step back for a moment and discuss your approach to implementing the mocks provided. You will cover things mostly at a high level, but should discuss a plan for the app's state.

- `.finally()` Once the bug is fixed and an approach has been decided upon, it's time to build. Take a deep breath, pat yourself on the back for getting this far, and show us what you've got!

After time has elapsed, please share with us your thoughts about where you'd take things if you had additional time. Better infrastructure? More features? You name it.

### Required Functionality
- App should load data from internal "API" and render UI with that data.
- UI should match provided mocks. You decide the order in which to implement for mobile/tablet/desktop. Please share your thoughts before beginning.
- Clicking the Add To Cart button should update the app's state to represent the quantity of products added to cart.
- Cart icon in header should show badge with current count of items in cart.

## CodeSandbox Gotchas
- The default magnification (zoom) level is tough to work with in a granular way between browser preview and editor. Decreasing the overall browser zoom should ensure you see desktop styles; try around 80% zoom.

## Available Scripts (Local Install Only)
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
Installs needed dependencies for app to build and run. This must be done before executing any other commands in the repo.

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.
